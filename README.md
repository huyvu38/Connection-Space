### Instruction on how to compile and run the program

The server in Server.java needs to be run first so that the client can connect to the server and use the app.

First, the user clicks the Run button in Client.java.

After the user connects with the server, the "Main Menu Frame" will appear with two options:

1. Create account

2. Log in


Main Menu Option 1: The user clicks on the "Create account" button.

The "Create Account Frame" will appear, and the user is prompted to enter username, password, age, gender, nationality, job, and hobby.

The server will then check that every information about the user is in the right format and the username is unique. After that, the client will receive a message if they created an account successfully or not. Then the program goes back to the "Main Menu Frame".

If the user creates an account successfully, they cannot edit their username later.


Main Menu Option 2: The user clicks on the "Log in" button.

The "Log in Frame" will appear, and the user will be prompted to enter username and password to log in. The server will check if the username and password match the database, and the client will receive the message if they log in successfully or not.

If the user logs in fail, the program will go back to the "Main Menu Frame".

If the user logs in successfully, the program will display the "User Frame" with the title "Connection Space".

The user will see some of the following buttons

1. Save

   The client writes to the text field about the new information, then clicks on the "Save" button and the server will check if the new information is in the correct format.

   If the client enters the wrong format of information, their profile details will be set back to the previous information.


2. Get friend list

   After clicking that button, the client can see all of their friends in the drop-down list.


3. Get block list

   After clicking that button, the client can see all the users that have been blocked in the drop-down list.

4. Search

  The client writes the text and the server will find all of the username that contain the text. The result will appear in the drop-down list.

5. Action

   After clicking to the "Action" button, the Action Frame will appear with some following buttons :

   1. Add friend/Delete friend/Block user/Unblock user
   
    The client first needs to type the username of other people and click to the any button that they want. The server will then check if that client can do that action and update any important changes to the database.

   2. View other user profile
   
   The client first needs to type the username, and another Frame will appear if no users block each other. Then the client can view another user's information, like age, gender, nationality, job, or hobby.
   
   3. Send Message
   
   In the messaging system, a user types their message into the message bar and clicks the "send" button. The sent message, along with any previous messages, is displayed in the message display area. Each message has an associated conversation ID, which is also displayed. If a user enters a specific conversation ID, they will no longer be able to see the messages from that conversation.

If a user attempts to send a message to another user who is on their block list, the message will not be sent. Instead, the message display area will show "No message yet." Users can exit the messaging dialog by clicking the "exit" button, which will return them to the main user frame.
   

   4. Log out

   The client will go back to the "Main Menu Frame" where they can log in or create account.

### Server.java <br/>

A class representing the server that allows client to connect, processing of data and update the data after the specific actions of the client. 
Utilizes java socket to create socket-client connections. All data is stored locally within server. 

#### Methods

Username Validation: Ensures usernames are unique and meet formatting standards.<br/>
Password Checks: Verifies password length for security and matches passwords for login.<br/>

Assure message is valid: Checks that messages are being sent to valid users who exist in the database.
Message Operations: Send individual or group messages, with options to delete and review message history.<br/>
Privacy Controls: Block specific users, hiding their messages from the recipient while still logging them.<br/>
Persistent Logging: Use a buffered reader to timestamp and store messages, ensuring a reliable historical record.<br/>

### Client.java <br>
